There’s a common problem in the software industry, especially among companies
that have survived rapid growth spurts: the best software engineers have nowhere
to go but up.

Up the management chain, that is—away from the code and the details, into the
land of meetings, roadmaps, architecture and cost planning. It seems a cruel
fate for the best craftspeople in their prime. Would we dare “promote” a
world-class painter, a few years into her self-defining work, to the
administrative department of a museum? …or a brilliant young author to a
copyediting position at a book publisher?

Some people choose the path of managing humans and projects, and that’s great,
but it behooves us all to create another path for those who don’t. In software
engineering, that second path is often called the “technical track”. Promises of
green fields and infinite code beckon from beyond the horizon for those who
would rather ply their craft and improve their skills over time. These promises
are sometimes empty or poorly explained because most software companies don’t
have a technical track that would encourage and define success.

## What does progress look like down the technical track?
We have only a few famous examples of unequivocal success on the technical
track, like [Guido van Rossum][1] and [Donald Knuth][2], but no real guidance on
how to set up that track. What if there were a better shared vision for the
technical track companies could use and modify to fit their needs? What if both
software companies and their engineers could be confident and excited about a
future of delivering code and details, not projections and spreadsheets for all?
What if, indeed.

The best technical track emphasizes growth, contribution and leadership, all
centered on a technical core. Although software engineers need people skills to
be successful on a team, and those skills should improve over time with their
technical skills, the focus of the technical track should be, well…technical.

## What does it mean to be an excellent software engineer?
This question serves as our foundation: what does “well-rounded” mean,
technically? I’ll first propose a few dimensions along which excellent software
engineers should excel, then in a later article describe how improvements along
these dimensions lead to real progress along the technical track.

1. **Productivity** – Above all else, an excellent software engineer is
   intensely productive, often creating many times the real business value
   created by their junior cohorts.
2. **Problem solving** – Excellence in software engineering can’t be defined
   without raw technical problem solving power across disciplines and with
   systems in varying states of repair.
3. **Quality** – The code, documentation and discussion output of an excellent
   software engineer are consistently high in quality, serving as examples for
   more junior developers.
4. **Technical knowledge** – Engineers should be knowledgeable about a wide
   range of systems and patterns in software engineering. They use this
   knowledge to better design new systems and train others.
5. **System design** – Commonly termed “architecture”, this is important for all
   software engineers, especially those who function in an organization without
   dedicated architects.
6. **Business/product knowledge** – The best software engineers understand their
   business’s industry and products intimately and work to deliver the best
   value for the business, not just for the sake of software itself.
7. **Data & evidence** – Relying on gut evaluations or haphazard debugging are
   more junior mistakes. The best engineers gather just enough data to prove
   themselves right and follow the data to a solution.
8. **Confidence & communication** – All of these attributes will be undersold if
   the engineer is not a confident, clear, concise and inspiring communicator to
   both business stakeholders and other engineers.
9. **Production support** – The best engineers know that their responsibility
   does not stop at the deployment of their code. They own their successes and
   mistakes all the way into production systems.
10. **Planning & execution** – Excellent project execution relies on methodical
    and consistent planning from all engineers involved. The best should lead
    these efforts by example.

At Return Path, these dimensions helpe define our technical track and map out
what it means to grow into an excellent software engineer. We work closely with
our engineers to ensure they are bettering themselves along two to three of
these at any given time, and they have a clear view of their future career path
in the company.

This is only half the battle, though. We can measure and tune to improve
engineers along this spectrum, but how do we recognize or define seniority along
the technical track? I’ll leave that question for next time.
