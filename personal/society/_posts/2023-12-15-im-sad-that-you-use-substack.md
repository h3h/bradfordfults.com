title: I’m Sad that You Use Substack
lang: en
tag: aside

I love independent publishing and especially platforms that enable authors to
stop worrying about the *process* of publishing so they can get to the content.
I am also a firm believer that we each help create the future world we live in
by what we write, read, fund, and support.

Substack has emerged to become the frontrunner of a new publishing style: paid
subscription newsletters delivered via email and the Web. Substack also has a
history of [supporting][SU] and even [proactively recruiting][PR] writers of
[hateful and abhorrent content][HC]. Their [stated content moderation
policy][CM] is a “hands-off approach,” and the reality of their enforcement of
even their limited *content guidelines* is lax, bordering on unserious.

This sucks, and we should not use their service.

## The part about free speech

People have, I think, wildly misunderstood and misapplied the concept of “free
speech” and specifically *who* is restricted from censoring speech and have
applied the idea more broadly to independent publishing from organizations and
individuals.

In fact, **as a company or as a person, you are under no obligation whatsoever
to publish speech with which you disagree**, or which you think just shouldn’t
be shared. And it should not be an act of revolution to simply stand for
principles as a publishing platform, at least at a level that doesn’t amount to
“everyone with a pulse has a valid opinion worth broadcasting.”

## Who we want to be

We are currently creating, every day, the world we will live in tomorrow. It has
become clear (or it always has been) that those publishers espousing support for
*radical free speech*, like Substack, are placing active bets on both sides of a
moral spectrum: they are supporting authors with helpful, constructive views,
*and* they are supporting authors with hateful, destructive views, while
profiting from both.

Of course free speech is good in society, and *governments* should not restrict
it, but we must each also take an active part in drawing the line in front of
morally desirable behavior when it comes to broadcast platforms, however
difficult that task may be. I would personally prefer to draw that line short of
amplifying both literal Nazis and insidiously loathsome intellectuals like
Jordan Peterson, but my point is that publishers can and should make their own
choice about where that line is, loudly and firmly. Then we can choose which of
them to support based on their values.

## Draw the line

Can you morally condemn calls for ethnic cleansing? Can you agree to stop
promotion of transphobia, homophobia and denying other humans’ right to exist?
Can you disassemble rather than disseminate pseudo-intellectual bullshit and
population-scale pathologies of male emotional insecurity and White supremacy?

I can. You should. Substack won’t. You should take your good thoughts to a
competitor like [Ghost.org][GO], which happens to be a nonprofit with a [Terms of
Service][TS] that includes this:

> By using any Service, you agree not to do, or permit others to do, any of the
> following:
> …
> Content that you believe or have reasonable grounds to suspect…promotes
> discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment, abuse or harm against any
> individual or group

Is Ghost a perfect organization of people? Probably not. But they’ve drawn a
line and they don’t have Substack’s slimy history or laughably lax enforcement.
Maybe that’s a solution. Maybe you can find better ones.
