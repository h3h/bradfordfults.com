title: A Better Approach to 360° Feedback
tag: essay
---

Many resources on [360° feedback][1] will tell you that the best questions to
ask are about a person’s performance or character as a whole. For instance:

* Does this employee act professionally?
* Does this employee follow instructions to achieve the desired results?
* Is this employee a good active listener?

While the intent behind these types of question can be good—uncovering
additional perspectives on interactions with the person under review—the
question framing is asking a reviewer to pass judgment on the holistic
performance or character of that person. This will often encourage reviewers to
inflate confidence in their own opinions, and make harsher or more final
judgments than their experience or role warrants.

Instead, it’s best to ask for reviews _within the context that the reviewer
actually interacts with the person under review._ So, instead of asking about a
performance attribute or character evaluation, a 360° review can ask a reviewer
about _their individual experience_ with the person under review, and ask for
specific citations of observed actions to support their interpretation of the
experience.

Humans also have a recency bias and suffer from long-term memory distortions
that change to fit their current opinions of other people. This means that
“observations” from months ago often aren’t so much observations as they are
current opinions and emotions repackaged as fixed stories about the past. Most
people don’t even intend to distort the truth like this: it’s just the way the
human brain works.

So then, to get a better idea of what’s happening between a person under review
and their reviewers, you might consider questions that take these biases and
limitations into account. For example:

* In the past 3 months, have you had any notable positive or negative
  experiences with this person with regard to them actively listening to you? If
  so, please describe your experience.
* In the past 3 months, has this person over-delivered on a project you were
  also a part of? If so, please describe your experience.
* In the past month, have you been in a meeting where this person didn’t attend,
  yet their presence would have been important to affecting the outcomes of the
  meeting? If so, please describe your experience.

You will have to work to create a set of good questions that examine various
aspects of a person’s role—and the questions really should be customized per
role under review, at least—but this is the type of work that will yield good
results for you and the person under review. This is the work of good
management.
