  <p class="salutation">Hey y’all,</p>
  <p class="p-summary">
    I am Bradford Fults, a thinker, software creator, organizational leader,
    feminist, humanist, philosopher and friend living deep in the heart of
    Texas, in the city of Austin. I enjoy driving fast cars, looking at houses,
    eating tacos and drinking whiskey and red wine.

  <p>
    I live my life and choose my actions according to <em>principles</em> of my
    own assembly. Many people derive their principles from religion or social
    institutions, or they live in a more reactive manner, focused on immediacy
    instead of tying their actions into an overall framework. I find that my
    principles work well for me, and am always delighted to find those who are
    also attempting to live by thoughtful principles of their own.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Quality</strong> as a first principle guides me toward performing
      the best version of every role I fill. Whether in work, relationships,
      recreation, or charity, I aim to pursue them with as much quality as
      possible. Not because of any particular desired end result, but because I
      value quality in the process itself—quality as a craft, a practice and a
      discipline. I should always be improving how I think and how I act.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Liberty</strong> is a principle to remind me that everything is
      affected by the relative distribution of power, and that how we as people
      use that power is important. From the beginning of civilization there have
      been only a few who hold power in most any given group of people. I
      believe it is my duty to embrace and extend <em>liberty</em> to as many
      people as possible, evening out the power distribution.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Perspective</strong> forms the background for everything else,
      reminding me that every single person has a unique perspective, made up of
      their own experiences, and possibly principles. I’ll never have the full
      picture of any situation, and I should listen, think and act with the care
      and knowledge that comes from being one part of a greater whole.
