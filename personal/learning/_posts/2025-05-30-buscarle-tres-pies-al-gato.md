Today I learned the idiom “Buscarle tres pies al gato,” which, literally
translated, means “to look for three legs on a cat.” The meaning is relatively
clear: it’s when someone is unnecessarily complicating a situation or looking
toward a solution that doesn’t exist.

Example:

> No le busques tres pies al gato; la solución es más sencilla.

I don’t know that there’s a good direct idiomatic analog in my dialect of
American English, but just the phrase “Don’t overcomplicate things.” gets the
meaning across.

Amusingly, it shares something in common with one of [Occam’s] original
formulations of [Occam’s razor][OR]:

> Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate

Which, translated, means “Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily.”
