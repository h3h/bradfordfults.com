A fast-paced political thriller, technically ambitious like one would expect
from Stephenson, but also full of schemes and clever relationships. This is my
second reading of the book (the first was in 2010), and I enjoyed both the
feverishly building suspense and the relatively accurate political conclusions,
far before our actual reality shift in 2016.

Interestingly, the two main narrative characters were both women: an upper-class
white daughter of a governor who insists on putting in hard work as a doctor,
and a middle-class-but-sliding Black woman who makes a hard distinction on
_values_, and some good points along with it.

Incredibly nuanced sociology it is not, but it is a thoughtful and often cheeky
commentary on American politics in the late-1990s era. I recommend it heartily.
