Today I learned the idiom “Buscarle tres pies al gato,” which, literally
translated, means “to look for three feet on a cat.”

The meaning (in which I’m assisted by my friend and native Spanish speaker
[@kinduff][KI]), is: when someone is unnecessarily complicating a situation or
looking for trouble that doesn’t exist.

Example:

> Maria no debe buscarle tres pies al gato; ya tenemos bastante problemas.

I don’t know that there’s a good direct idiomatic analog in my dialect of
American English, but just the phrase “Don’t overcomplicate things.” gets the
meaning across.

[Google Translate][GT] thinks that “splitting hairs” works. [Kagi Translate][KT]
offers up “making a mountain out of a molehill.”

Amusingly, it also shares something in common with one of [Occam’s] original
formulations of [Occam’s razor][OR]:

> Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate

Which, translated, means “Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily.”
