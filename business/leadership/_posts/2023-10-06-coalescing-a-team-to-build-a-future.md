title: Coalescing a Team to Build a Future Together

I was talking with someone about the challenges of taking a team from a
competent but disorganized set of different functions to an integrated whole
that is delivering value directly to customers.

For a product company, this means that your product development (R&D),
marketing, sales, and service functions are all working together with the _same
intent_ toward the _same goals_. But there is an order in which this can be best
approached:

  1. **Establish a shared vocabulary** – If your teams are using different words
     for concepts within your product, for customer problems, or for market
     gaps, your plans to respond will be equally disconnected.

     Begin by stepping back, starting with the real customers and the real
     product you have today, and wherever possible, use the terminology of the
     customer to describe problems they have and solutions that your product
     offers.
  2. **Understand your _current_ challenges & opportunities** – Top of mind for
     each function will be many improvements your company could make today to
     make that function’s job easier or more effective.

     Write them down and internalize the expert opinions of your functional
     teams, then set them aside.
  3. **Create a future product vision** – Much ink has been spent describing
     viable methods for creating a product vision—which at a product company,
     _is_ the company vision—so I won’t rehash them here.

     Suffice to say, you need to know your market and where it’s headed, you
     should understand your customers at an operational and an emotional level,
     and you should combine your company’s unique advantages into the
     description of a possible future that is _motivating_, _constraining_, and
     _clarifying_ for the members of your team.
  4. **Draft & prioritize roadmaps based on _leverage_** – Look back at your
     list of ideas for improvements & efficiency, then add to that list with new
     ideas from your team, whether for your product or your operations, inspired
     from your product vision.

     Combine the lists and look for the _highest-leverage_ potential changes:
     those that will grow and improve your business most with the smallest
     investment of capital and effort. Execute on only those items that align
     with your vision and give you leverage, with intense focus. Then ship them.
  5. **Learn from customers & prospects** – Don’t forget about feedback loops!
     Especially in a complex system like a product company trying to create,
     sell, service & maintain products, it is critical for your _whole team_ to
     understand how your customers are doing with your product, and what might
     be next.

     You can improve your understanding of where your market is going by
     understanding your prospects’ problems and emotions as well. Learn from
     them and use it as input to your next iteration on your vision.

You should be able to repeat this process from Step 2 with refinement in place
of creation at the various steps, but your practice should be a repeated one.

This certainly falls into one of those “simple but difficult” categories of
work in life, and that’s where excellent leadership will deliver better, faster
more sustainable results that can lead to compounding success for your business.
