  <p class="salutation">Hey yâ€™all,</p>
  <p class="p-summary">
    I am Bradford Fults, a thinker, software creator, organizational leader,
    feminist, humanist, philosopher and friend living deep in the heart of
    Texas, in the city of Austin.
  </p>
  <p>
    I live my life and choose my actions according to <em>principles</em> of my
    own assembly. Many people derive their principles from religion or social
    institutions, or they live in a more reactive manner, focused on immediacy
    instead of tying their actions into an overall framework. I find that my
    principles work well for me, and am always delighted to find those who are
    also attempting to live by thoughtful principles of their own.
