It’s difficult living through the destruction of one’s society. Writing about it
seems even more difficult. There’s just too much. How should one choose what to
write about?

It is easier now to see why we admire past authors who wrote during social
crises: they found something vital and true amidst the chaos, and they managed
to put it into words for others. Risking reputation, punishment, and even death,
they gave voice to a human experience that was true _despite_ the wishes of the
jealous and murderous powers of their time. Authors like [Žižek][SZ],
[Havel][VH], [Sartre][JPS], [Borges][JLB], [Poniatowska][EP], and [Pushkin][AP].

Journalists, too, deserve respect for their courage, but their narrow focus
necessarily makes the job a little bit easier: just report the news. String
together a coherent narrative of truth and analysis. Tell the people what is
happening. But authors and essayists are often unmoored; paralyzed over what to
say that would be both vital and true.

## Reacting: Skillfully & Not

Comedic genius will always be a cornerstone of our collective capability to
process trauma. Comedians who find a way to share the truth are deploying a
skill to bring coherence and attention to the chaos. They also deserve our
respect and appreciation.

Most people, though, simply cannot seem to shut up. As if somehow writing eight
hundred words on their marketing scheme for startups or the best travel tips for
those who can successfully ignore a dying indigenous tribe on a beautiful
sinking island will salve their ills. But that’s not it, is it? They’re
hustling. Anything for a buck. Someone has to juice the ROI while others set up
the concentration camps.

> Wise men speak because they have something to say; fools because they have to
> say something.

Sounds about right.

## Seeking Wisdom

Maybe we just start with the basics and go from there. What is vital? What is
true?

1. It is immoral and unacceptable for a government to detain humans and put them
   in dangerous or unhealthy conditions, regardless of the reasons or the humans.

1. Government police who operate in secrecy and without identification, arresting
   and disappearing people from the streets, are an illegitimate use of the
   monopoly on violence.

1. A citizen ignoring their government’s immoral actions is an act of moral
   avoidance. From a privileged citizen, it is cowardice. Persisting in willful
   ignorance while that government disappears, maims, and kills one’s neighbors
   is a direct invitation to become a victim of the same government’s caprice.

1. The magnitudes of a government’s lies are directly related to how corrupt and
   immoral that government is.

1. Seeking truth and exposing lies, corruption, alliances with bad actors,
   violence, and killings is always vital to protect large groups of vulnerable
   humans from being controlled and hunted by comparatively small groups in
   power.

1. The fact of a person’s or government’s current power is the result of
   collective belief and permission, not a bare universal fact like gravity.
   Collective will against those in power has, can, and will lead to a change in
   the powerful.

## Opinions, Fascism & Tragedy

There’s a whole lot else that seems worth saying, but which would quickly
devolve into opinions, preferences, or observations that, though supported by
research and history, may be arguable at the edges. Like: _Hosting and
supporting a diversity of cultures, viewpoints, personalities, and desires
builds enduring strength and incredibly fruitful societies._

But one of the first things they teach you at Fascist School is that there are
no facts, not really. There is only what _feels right_, and what _feels wrong_
(and then the fascists helpfully tell you how to feel). And the bad guys. There
are always bad guys. Somehow they are never the guys doing the disappearing or
the genocide. Funny that.

There is nothing terribly new or interesting about this story, where one group
of humans exploits the lizard-brain fears of the masses to gain immense power
and extinguish opposition to that same power. Maybe only that it’s juxtaposed
with a recent history of relative calm, progress, and respect for a preciously
new concept we call “human rights.” I think that makes it a tragic arc, but not
a new one.

## From Whence It Came

I’m sure the hand-wringing and whining about _how this could possibly happen_ is
also not new. It’s not even like these particular masses were uneducated about
the history of fascism, genocide, human rights abuses, or the demises of past
empires. Well, those things were in the curriculum, at least. Were any of them
paying attention, or just worrying about who would win the Friday night football
game?

No, the root of this particular bugabear is as simple as it is devilish: a real,
actual, awful and tragic set of economic circumstances befell a generation left
behind by technological progress combined with rapacious capitalist greed. As it
happened, that generation was also less educated and ready to hear about how
their problems came from unknown people living states away.

Then there were the “J6ers,” who are just regular white supremacist assholes.
The type of people who do have money and some education, but who turn out to be
vile and hateful people concerned primarily with accumulation of status, power,
or wealth. And especially so when their perceived adversaries are outside of
their tribe. The kind of people who you just really want to punch in the face
because they will absolutely pull a gun on you in a Walmart parking lot for
getting in the way of their absurdly large vehicle. Snide. Entitled. Racist.
Assholes. It doesn’t need to be more complicated than that. They aren’t the
majority, just the leverage point.

## Where to Go

Some people have left the country altogether, including, not ironically, the
foremost academic experts on fascism. This is a pretty understandable reaction:
move yourself to ensure freedom over your physical body and your family. (Note:
Leaving the U.S. for the exact reasons of freedom and safety while red hats
scream about “freedom” _is_, in fact, ironic.)

Most people will not have that option. So what is left? Peaceful protest, of
course. And it is actually quite effective, historically. Especially when 3–4%
of the entire population is visible and consistent in their opposition to abuses
of power. That’s generally all it takes. That’s 10–14 million people though.
Which is a lot.

But if you can’t protest visibly? Funding, organizing, encouraging, conversing,
and writing are all good options. Ask your red hat acquaintances and family
members specific questions about abuses of power and if they personally want
to  see them perpetrated against innocent people. Most don’t.

And for those who do want inhuman treatment of some hated group of the moment? I
don’t think punching Nazis in the face will ever go out of style.
